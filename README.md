# blast-off
The name is ironic as it does not use the NCBI blast systems at all

Utilizing the accession code editor you can add or remove genomes to your hearts content,
so long as the codes pull a genbank style file.

Future work will fully realize the intitialization functions for the application, as
well as returning a sequence allignment for searches.

I will also compartamentalize the application so that each module is in its own seperate .py
file, because I realize the monstrosity that it currently is. This will likely occur when
I get sick of hearing about ensemble epistasis but still have the need to be productive.
